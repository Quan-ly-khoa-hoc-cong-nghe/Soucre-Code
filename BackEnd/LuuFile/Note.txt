	There has been a rising debate in the world, including Vietnam, over (chủ đề). While components of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of (chủ đề). This essay aims to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a situation and draw a conclusion.

	On the one hand, (chủ đề) is beneficial (for ai) in some ways. One of the most prominent positives is that (Ưu điểm 1). In other words, (diễn đạt lại ưu điểm 1). For example, (ví dụ cho ưu điểm 1). Another plus point of (chủ đề) is that (ưu điểm 2). That is because (lí do 2). For instance, (ví dụ 2 ). The final benefit (of chủ đề) is that (ưu điểm 3). More specifically, (diễn giải 3).

I find myself in agreement/disagreement with that opinion and discussed below are the reasons and examples to support my arguments

	First and foremost, it should be recognized that (lí do 1). In other words, (giải thích). One example to support this view is (ví dụ).This proves that (chủ đề) has a positive/negative impact on (ai/cái gì).

	At the same time, it is pointed out that (lí do 2). This arises from the fact that (giải thích). A typical example to illustrate this point is that (ví dụ). This evidence demonstrates that (quan điểm mình đồng y)

	In conclusion, this essay has shed light on my perspective on the stated topic. It stands to reason that (nhận định mình đồng y.). However, every coin has two sides and this situation is no exception. Therefore, its merits should be promoted, and its downsides should be condemned
